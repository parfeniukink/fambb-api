"""
this package encapsulates all the available transactions:
* COST - because of 'costs'
* INCOME - because there are many 'income sources'
* EXCHANGE - because of 'currency exchange'

the 'Transaction' itself stands for a shared instance that
represents shared parameters for all types of operations.

in general, this module is about CURD operations of the next tables:
- currencies
- cost_categories
- costs
- incomes
- exchanges

also you can find the domain validation and other batteries in that package.
