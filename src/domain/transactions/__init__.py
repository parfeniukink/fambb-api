"""
This package encapsulates all the available transactions:
* COST - because of 'costs'
* INCOME - because there are many 'income sources'
* EXCHANGE - because of 'currency exchange'


The 'Transaction' itself stands for a shared instance that
represents shared parameters for all types of operations.
